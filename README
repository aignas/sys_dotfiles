This is my dotfiles repository.

The workflow goes like that.

I copy all the files I want to this folder and then have a scrpt (from Adrian C. or anrxc) which basically checks whether the files and folder in the directory are up to date with the ones in the home repository.

To sync repository with computer (not vice versa) I use a rakefile which is quite common around here.

Every computer follows master branch and have local branches for local changes.
