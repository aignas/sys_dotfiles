This is the repository for my dotfiles.

I have not used this in a while, but now I understood, that I need it in order
to get updates and easy backup if I tinker with the settings too much. Please
note that this repository is not the actual files in my HOME directory, but
rather copies, which are made with the update.sh script. The script was
originally taken from Uli Schlachter (psychon), but then heavily modified to
suit my needs.

The workflow goes as follows:
    - the repo contains all crucial files
    - the copies are made with the update script
    - the files can be restored with the same script, but just issuing the
        command with a different parameter
    - if I will have more machines than one or something similar, then I will
        add branches for all machines and master will have only the common
        things, whereas the branches will have unique customizations.

Thanks to psychon and anrxc, who inspired me and I must admit that their repos
where a good example for me.
